Mylar is an automated ComicBook (cbr/cbz) downloader program heavily-based on the Headphones template and logic (which is also based on Sick-Beard). Please note, before you laugh hysterically at my code, I have only started learning python (<2 months ago) and this is my first 'pet project.'

I will be putting up the source as soon as I can figure out the inner workings of git - in the meantime here are some screenshots that will have to suffice.

And yes, it does work for the most part (Alpha stage).
